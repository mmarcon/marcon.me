title: On time management and GTD
description: It's quite common for Product Managers to have more things to do than there is time during the day. This article is about how I manage my time to get (most of my) things done.

Our role as Product Managers involves several responsibilities. We jump from the day to day work with the team to planning what our product should be in the next quarter and in the next 2 years, to syncing with sales and technical support on how our latest release is addressing the biggest pain points customers have, to talking directly to customers and users to collect first-hand feedback. Our calendar is typically filled with colorful rectangles and we are left with very little time to think, write, plan. How do we find the time to get stuff done? How do we avoid the continuous context switch that prevents us from being productive and work on the most important things?

As I think I found a relatively good balance for myself, I thought I'd share what I currently do to manage my time effectively and how I find the time I need to think.

## My Product Manager role

To put this post a bit more in context, I am going to start with listing the things I currently do as part of my job of Product Manager at [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com). The list is not supposed to be complete and will likely change over time, it's just a list of things I am currently juggling in my typical day.

* **Backlog management**: this is essentially the day to day work with the engineering team. It's about making sure the top priorities are identified and ready to go into the next iteration, about monitoring bug reports and triaging them with the team and about ensuring that the projects we work on in the current quarter are broken down into user stories we can work on.
* **Design reviews and sync meetings**: as product design is located in a different continent, a lot of our collaboration happens asynchronously. We exchange and review Google Docs where we describe user research efforts and we draft user surveys and we share and comment on Invision prototypes for the upcoming features. To complement this asynchronous communication, once per week we have a 1 hour video-call scheduled to brainstorm around new ideas for the product, to sign-off on new designs or to quickly go through the comments we put in Invision.
* **Dig into product data**: a big part of my job is to understand if and how users are using my product. I dedicate some of my time going through our analytics and our qualitative research to gather insights on my users to check the outcome of what was done in the past and inform my decisions on what comes next.
* **Research new features and new directions for the product**: while it's pretty clear what we are working on in the next few weeks, or typically until the end of the quarter, what happens next is a bit more fuzzy. I allocate part of my time to research and think about what we should do next and how that aligns with the product strategy and the overall company strategy.
* **Speak to customers, technical support and customer success**: all of this is key to understanding our customers and their expectations with the product.
* **Read and respond to emails and Slack chats, have 1:1s, have ad-hoc meetings**: I put all of this in the same bucket as it's mostly about communication: staying and keep the others in the loop, talking to stakeholders, exchanging ideas with peers, etc.

This is a lot, and probably in the attempt of grouping things together I even forgot to mention other things I do.

To make sure I get as much of this done as it is possible, I make an effort to write everything I need to do in a to do list, prioritize the work and allocate time to get it done.

In the rest of the article, I will talk about the process and tools I use to make all of this a bit more organized and achievable.
