title: On time management and GTD
description: It's quite common for Product Managers to have more things to do than there is time during the day. This article is about how I manage my time to get (most of my) things done.

Our role as Product Managers involves several responsibilities. We jump from the day to day work with the team to planning what our product should be in the next quarter and in the next 2 years, to syncing with sales and technical support on how our latest release is addressing the biggest pain points customers have, to talking directly to customers and users to collect first-hand feedback. Our calendar is typically filled with colorful rectangles and we are left with very little time to think, write, plan. How do we find the time to get stuff done? How do we avoid the continuous context switch that prevents us from being productive and work on the most important things?

As I think I found a relatively good balance for myself, I thought I'd share what I currently do to manage my time effectively and how I find the time I need to think.

## My Product Manager role

To put this post a bit more in context, I am going to start with listing the things I currently do as part of my job of Product Manager at [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com). The list is not supposed to be complete and will likely change over time, it's just a list of things I am currently juggling in my typical day.

* **Backlog management**: this is essentially the day to day work with the engineering team. It's about making sure the top priorities are identified and ready to go into the next iteration, about monitoring bug reports and triaging them with the team and about ensuring that the projects we work on in the current quarter are broken down into user stories we can work on.
* **Design reviews and sync meetings**: as product design is located in a different continent, a lot of our collaboration happens asynchronously. We exchange and review Google Docs where we describe user research efforts and we draft user surveys and we share and comment on Invision prototypes for the upcoming features. To complement this asynchronous communication, once per week we have a 1 hour video-call scheduled to brainstorm around new ideas for the product, to sign-off on new designs or to quickly go through the comments we put in Invision.
* **Dig into product data**: a big part of my job is to understand if and how users are using my product. I dedicate some of my time going through our analytics and our qualitative research to gather insights on my users to check the outcome of what was done in the past and inform my decisions on what comes next.
* **Research new features and new directions for the product**: while it's pretty clear what we are working on in the next few weeks, or typically until the end of the quarter, what happens next is a bit more fuzzy. I allocate part of my time to research and think about what we should do next and how that aligns with the product strategy and the overall company strategy.
* **Speak to customers, technical support and customer success**: all of this is key to understanding our customers and their expectations with the product.
* **Read and respond to emails and Slack chats, have 1:1s, have ad-hoc meetings**: I put all of this in the same bucket as it's mostly about communication: staying and keep the others in the loop, talking to stakeholders, exchanging ideas with peers, etc.

This is a lot and probably, in the attempt of grouping things together, I even forgot to mention other things I do.

To make sure I get as much of this done as it is possible, I make an effort to write everything I need to do in a to do list, prioritize the work and allocate time to get it done.

In the rest of the article, I will talk about the process and tools I use to make all of this a bit more organized and achievable.

## Tools

Most of the tools I use to keep my work organized and efficient are included in [G Suite](https://gsuite.google.com/).

### To-do list

My to do list is in Tasks. While tasks isn't as powerful as dedicated to-do apps, it has everything I need:

* A sortable list of tasks with a title and a description
* Each task can be assigned a date and time
* Tasks with date and time are visible in my calendar
* Available on web and on iOS

As an additional nice to have, I can open Tasks in a sidebar next to my calendar, email or any other Google document, spreadsheet or presentation.

Tasks contain my personal backlog of things I know I need to do in the near future – those typically have a date/time attached – and things I should probably do at some point but without any urgency – those don't have a date.

### Calendar

Google Calendar is my tool of choice. All my work appointments are there so I make sure I don't miss a meeting, a call or a team lunch. My tasks are also visible there, and that is really helpful to make sure I don't forget do to what I decided I need to do.

I use the calendar a lot also to plan _focused time_, i.e. blocks in my calendar where I plan to do focused work and I don't want anybody to drag me into meetings.

### Notes

Notes are a tricky topic for me. I am super messy when it comes to writing notes and I tend to always try the new, shiny, note taking application that shows up on Product Hunt.

I think I am now fairly settled with Google Keep. While it's not my favorite note-taking app, it's well integrated with the rest of G Suite products and I can have in a panel next to my calendar, email or any other Google document so I can quickly write down the random thoughts I have when working on something else.

One thing I like a lot is that when I create a note in the side panel and I have an email opened in Gmail or I am reading a Google document, spreadsheet or presentation, the note automatically includes a link to the email or document.

My wishlist for Google Keep includes: basic formatting (bold, italic, underlined, strikethrough, bulleted lists) and document/whiteboard/post-it scanning in the iOS app.

### Product Backlog, Bug tracking, etc.

The choice here is typically dictated by the company you work for: MongoDB is standardized on JIRA and most of the processes we have are mapped to a corresponding series of steps in JIRA.

I don't particularly like JIRA but I have to say that what I found when I joined MongoDB is simple enough that I don't mind it.

I organized most of what I need to take care of in a personal dashboard. When I go to work in the morning, I open my dashboard and check if there is anything I need to take care of.

JIRA sends me a lot of emails too. I completely ignore them, they are labeled "JIRA" and get automatically archived. I prefer to work with the tool on my own terms instead of being dragged into the tool by email reminders.

### Research, proposals, meeting notes, and reports

Most of the work I do around researching new features and products, interviewing customers, discussing with stakeholders is logged in Google docs. I find it to be the easiest way to write things down, copy-paste images, include links and, most importantly, share with other people to get suggestions and comments.

Meeting notes go to Google docs too, and are shared with the other people in the meeting, no matter if it's a 1:1 meeting or a meeting with 20 people.

For reports, I usually put together a Google presentation. It makes it easier to write things down in the form of a bulleted summary and to include charts about the metrics we are tracking. A slide deck serves both the purpose of sending it around for asynchronous consumption as well as visual support in case I need to present it to someone.

## Process

I admit I have issues with following processes. However, since I started doing product a few years back, I recognized I needed some process to get stuff done.

When I left my previous job, someone told me I tend to be disorganized. With that in mind, I am doing my best to be as organized as possible.

### Calendar Grooming

### Meeting preparation

Scheduled meeting preparation, no matter if it's a customer meeting, a 1:1 or a 1-week team offsite.

Prepping for meetings ahead of time and even sending prep-notes to participants in advance is helpful to a) make sure everybody is on the same page b) sometime even resolve things before the meeting so the meeting may not even need to happen

### Thinking time

Is there something I need to think about? Walk to work, walk to lunch, walk home.

### Research time

Scheduled research time.

### Growth time

Over coffee, in the morning, as soon as I get to the office, if nothing urgent.
