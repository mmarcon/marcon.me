This shortcut appears on the iOS Share Sheet and on the macOS menu bar.

It receives the URL of an article or any other web page, and it creates a calendar event at 9am of the first day that does not already have a "Remember to Read" event to remind you to read it.

The goal if to help you schedule 15 minutes a day that you can spend reading an article you feel is interesting or relevant for your work and learn something new every day.

By default, events are created on the `Home` calendar but you can adjust that to any calendar you have cconfigured in Apple Calendar, even if they are hidden by Focus Filters are the time when the event is created.
