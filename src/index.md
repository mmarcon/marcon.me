I work where engineering meets product. I specialize in prototyping and productizing solutions that create value for users and customers. I currently work at [HERE](https://here.com), where I lead an engineering team that builds cloud services to make maps [smarter and more personal](http://360.here.com/2016/01/20/introducing-third-party-content-make-personal/).

In my role I am both a technology expert as well as a product consultant. *What is the minimum we need to build to ship this product?* *With the technology stack we have, what products can we build? What are others doing in the same space?*. These are all questions I spend my time researching and answering.
