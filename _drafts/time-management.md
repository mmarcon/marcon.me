title: On time management and GTD
description: It's quite common for Product Managers to have more things to do than there is time during the day. This article is about how I manage my time to get (most of my) things done.

Our role as Product Managers involves several responsibilities. We jump from the day to day work with the team to planning what our product should be in the next quarter and in the next 2 years, to syncing with sales and technical support on how our latest release is addressing the biggest pain points customers have, to talking directly to customers and users to collect first-hand feedback. Our calendar is typically filled with colorful rectangles and we are left with very little time to think, write, plan. How do we find the time to get stuff done? How do we avoid the continuous context switch that prevents us from being productive and work on the most important things?

As I think I found a relatively good balance for myself, I thought I'd share what I currently do to manage my time effectively and how I find the time I need to think.

## My Product Manager role

To put this post a bit more in context, I am going to start with listing the things I currently do as part of my job of Product Manager at [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com). The list is not supposed to be complete and will likely change over time, it's just a list of things I am currently juggling in my typical day.

* Backlog management: this is essentially the day to day work with the engineering team. It's about making sure the top priorities are identified and ready to go into the next iteration, about monitoring bug reports and triaging them with the team and about ensuring that the projects we work on in the current quarter are broken down into user stories we can work on.
