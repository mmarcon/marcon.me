Maps are cool, but map APIs are complicated. [jHERE](http://jhere.net) solves this problem by offering a simple but powerful map API in the form of a jQuery plugin.

With jHERE, you can easily add interactive maps to your website. In only 5KB (2KB Gzipped), you get a powerful map API, highly customizable markers, event handling and info bubbles. Bonus features are KML support and data visualization via heatmaps.

jHERE is built on top of the awesome and very solid HERE Maps API. For advanced users, the native API is exposed by jHERE, thus offering unlimited possibilities of customization.

### Extensions

In order to keep jHERE as small as possible, the plugin contains only a subset of all the functionalities that are available via the HERE Maps API.

Everything else is available via extensions. [Several extensions](https://github.com/mmarcon/jhere/blob/master/EXTENSIONS.md) are already available on Github.

Geocoding, routing, shapes are just a few examples of what can be done with extensions.
