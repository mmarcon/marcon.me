I am a product guy with more than 10 years of experience in building and shipping all sorts of products.
I believe in the importance of researching what users want and what others are doing before investing time and money to build new software.

I am a big supporter of [rapid prototyping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_prototyping) as a way to test feasibility and assumptions and to estimate projects.
