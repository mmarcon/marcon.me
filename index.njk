    I work where product meets engineering. I specialize in building products and solutions that
    create value for users and customers. I work with a great team at <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/" title="MongoDB allows your teams to easily organize, use and enrich data â€“ in real time, anywhere.">MongoDB</a>, where we make tools to make developers happy.
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong>We create tools that make it easy for developers to explore and manipulate their data stored in MongoDB.</strong> I spend my time with engineering, product design,
  customers and users to build:
