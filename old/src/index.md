I work where product meets engineering. I specialize in prototyping and productizing solutions that create value for users and customers. With my team, I craft IoT products at [HERE](https://here.com).

**We transform location services into beautiful user experiences.** We are building an IoT product that makes [future workplaces
smarter and data-driven](https://360.here.com/bringing-location-technology-to-the-workplace.-call-for-early-adopters), allowing for the effective use and distribution of space, time, and resources.

If you want to read more about what I do, have a look at [my CV](cv.html). I am also pretty good at coding, you can see some of the
things I have built in [my Github profile](https://github.com/mmarcon).
