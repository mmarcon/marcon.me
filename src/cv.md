I am a software engineer with more than 10 years of experience with building
all sort of things. I am very product focused: I believe on the importance of reasearching what users want and what others are doing before investing time and money to build new software.

I am a big supporter of [rapid prototyping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_prototyping) as a way to test feasibility and assumptions and to estimate projects.

### Education

#### Courses

##### **Usable Security (Coursera - University of Maryland, College Park)**<br><small>November 2014</small>

This course focuses on how to design and build secure systems with a human-centric focus.
Starting from the basic principles of human-computer interaction, these insights are applied to the design of secure systems with the goal of developing security measures that respect human performance and their goals within a system.

##### **Maps and the Geospatial Revolution (Coursera - The Pennsylvania State University)**<br><small>August 2013</small>

This course is about how advances in geospatial technology and analytical methods have changed how we do everything, and teaches how to make maps and analyze geographic patterns using the latest tools.
