I am a software engineer with more than 10 years of experience with building
all sort of things. I am very product focused: I believe on the importance of reasearching what users want and what others are doing before investing time and money to build new software.

I am a big supporter of [rapid prototyping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_prototyping) as a way to test feasibility and assumptions and to estimate projects.
